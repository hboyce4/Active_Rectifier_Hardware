Design files (Altium) for my bidirectional active rectifier. 

A Cortex-M4-driven bidirectional AC-DC power converter (active rectifier). 300W, 48VDC, 12VAC rms (through mains freq. step-down transformer). It should also be able to absorb/provide AC reactive power too. Its aim is more to be a test platform for control software than a useful/economical PSU.
